# Smart Prediction for Shared Bicycles

This repository contains my final project for the Data Bootcamp course at NYU.

## Project Contents

- `report/final_report.pdf`: The written report (approx. 3,400 words), following the required structure (introduction, data, models, results, and next steps).  
  **Note**: Due to word limit, I did not include detailed EDA visuals in the report itself.

- `notebooks/1_EDA_and_Modeling.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains both the **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and the **modeling code**, with all EDA insights and visualizations embedded in markdown cells.

- `data/day.csv`: The original dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast daily bike rental counts using weather and calendar features. I compared four models—Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—and evaluated their performance using RMSE, MAE, R², and visual analysis. Among them, **Random Forest** performed best in terms of both accuracy and generalization.
